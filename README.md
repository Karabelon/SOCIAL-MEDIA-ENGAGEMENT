# SOCIAL-MEDIA-ENGAGEMENT
Data analysis project exploring posts engagement across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter using Excel only.
This project explores engagement patterns across **Facebook**, **Instagram**, and **Twitter** using cleaned data and visual storytelling. The goal is to help social media managers understand what works — when to post, what to post, and how audience sentiment affects performance.

##  Data Cleaning Steps (Excel)

-  Separated `Post_Date` and `Post_Time` into individual columns  
-  Deleted unnecessary cells and irrelevant columns  
-  Removed **duplicate rows** to ensure clean and accurate data  
-  Created a `Time Bucket` column to classify post times into:
  - **Morning** (06:00–12:00)
  - **Afternoon** (12:00–18:00)
  - **Evening** (18:00–00:00)
  - **Night** (00:00–06:00)
